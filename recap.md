# Recap of Front-end Development in 2017

* HTML 5.2 is [done](https://www.w3.org/blog/2017/12/html-5-2-is-done-html-5-3-is-coming/).
* It was a banner year for [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) in terms of adoption and popularity. [No question](https://www.npmjs.com/npm/state-of-javascript-frameworks-2017-part-1) about [it](https://stateofjs.com/2017/front-end/results/).
* The [great](https://medium.com/@jerrylowm/the-death-of-front-end-developers-803a95e0f411) divide between a front-end HTML & CSS developer v.s. [front-end application developer is realized/verbalized](https://medium.com/@mandy.michael/is-there-any-value-in-people-who-cannot-write-javascript-d0a66b16de06).
* Being a Front-end JavaScript developer who builds applications using web technologies continues to get better and [worse](https://blog.logrocket.com/the-increasing-nature-of-frontend-complexity-b73c784c09ae).
* This year seemed fuller than most of app/framework solutions trying to contend with the mainstream JavaScript app tools (i.e. [React, Angular, and Vue etc...](https://stateofjs.com/2017/front-end/results)) Let me list them for you. [Moon](http://moonjs.ga/docs/overview.html), [Marko](https://markojs.com/), [Hyperapp](https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp), [Quasar Framework](http://quasar-framework.org/), [POI](https://poi.js.org), [frint](https://frint.js.org/), [BunnyJS](https://bunnyjs.com/), [jsblocks](http://jsblocks.com/), [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.technology/), [Stimulus](https://github.com/stimulusjs/stimulus), [Choo](https://github.com/choojs/choo), 
* This was the year that jsbin and jsfiddle evolved to things like [StackBliz](https://stackblitz.com/) and [codeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/). Making it dead simple to share a working app.
* React continues to be flattered by things like [preact](https://preactjs.com/), [inferno](https://infernojs.org/), [nerv](https://github.com/NervJS/nerv), [dva](https://github.com/dvajs/dva), and [rax](https://github.com/alibaba/rax).
* Cheatsheets got organized with [devhints.io](https://devhints.io/).
* We figured out that the correct pattern for an app boilerplate/cli tool is something very opinionated like [React Create App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) with the ability to [escape](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#npm-run-eject) from it when needed.
* Most developers found that the combination of a really good [code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [eslint](https://eslint.org/), and now [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) make writing code faster, easier, pleasurable.
* CSS [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) and [Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) gain browser support and thus more developers are paying [attention to both](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2016/03/30/should-i-use-grid-or-flexbox/).
* We [get](https://blog.chromium.org/2017/05/chrome-59-beta-headless-chromium-native.html), a [headless chrome](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/lkgr/headless/README.md), finally.
* You no longer need Less or Sass [to do](https://shoelace.style) amazing [things with CSS](http://cssnext.io/features/).
* CSS [revolutions/revolts](http://ryanogles.by/css/javascript/2017/05/25/the-state-of-css.html) are under way.
* JavaScript object explorer tools have arrived, [JavaScript Array Explorer](https://sdras.github.io/array-explorer/)
and [JavaScript Object Explorer](https://sdras.github.io/object-explorer/). This is a handy interface pattern for learning about JavaScript data types (e.g. Objects and Arrays) and their methods. 
* The [Chrome web browser dominates the market](http://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share) and people begin to fear the past might be [repeating itself](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16805216/google-chrome-only-sites-internet-explorer-6-web-standards).
* [Brave](https://brave.com/) becomes the most pleasant and safest way to browser the internet.
* [PhantomJS is no longer maintained](https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/04/Phantomjs-future-uncertain), [Headless Chrome](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/lkgr/headless/README.md) and [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) step in.
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) comes from left field and becomes a staple for development.
* A whole lot of developers adopt static type checking for mostly subjective reasons or band wagon emotions. Some sell out completely to [Typescript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript) and the Microsoft way of doing things while others take on a slower approach with [Flow](https://github.com/facebook/flow). One thing is for sure, most developers don't need types, they are simply complicating already complex problems and solutions. Like most things, most of this trend is subjective dogma not objective value.
* [Static site generators](https://www.staticgen.com/) & [API CMS tools aka Headless CMS's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_CMS) are now on most developers radar.
* Web components still lurking and wait for significant traction by developers that might never come to be.
* JavaScript settled and [CSS erupt](http://michelebertoli.github.io/css-in-js/) and everyone will cry fatigue by this time next year.
* A lot of people stop doing CSS in CSS and [move](https://speakerdeck.com/vjeux/react-css-in-js) to [CSS in JS](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/a-brief-history-of-css-in-js-how-we-got-here-and-where-were-going-ea6261c19f04) when building application using component trees.
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) seems to have filled a need, because a lot of people jump the npm ship. However, the real value of Yarn is the fact that it brings competition to NPM. Making npm better.
* A new video format for Interactive coding screencasts (recording of working in a live editor that you can edit too) becomes a real thing with [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/about).
* Most people begin to see the correlation between [component architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component-based_software_engineering) and [atomic design](http://patternlab.io/).
* And so it begins that ES modules [will](https://philipwalton.com/articles/deploying-es2015-code-in-production-today/) be [part](https://medium.com/dev-channel/es6-modules-in-chrome-canary-m60-ba588dfb8ab7) of [the browser](https://caniuse.com/#feat=es6-module) and if used a [backup plan](https://github.com/WebReflection/ecma) will be required (i.e. a bundle from something like webpack).
* [MVC frameworks are on the outs](https://codeburst.io/javascript-trends-in-2018-3fb0077259).
* Developing and displaying React components outside of your applications is made popular by tools like [Bluekit](http://bluekit.blueberry.io/), [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), [React Styleguidist](Styleguidist), and [bit](https://bitsrc.io/).
* Getting a front-end job in 2017 is about [experience, which is displayed from personal projects and a developers Github account](https://research.hackerrank.com/developer-skills/2018/).
* [Preloading](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Preloading_content) resources (CSS, JavaScript, Media etc..) from HTML documents [arrives](https://www.w3.org/TR/preload/).
* [Cypress arrives](https://www.cypress.io/how-it-works/) as a complete testing solution and hopefully testing will get better as end to end testing becomes the focus for app code.
* [WebAssembly support now shipping in all major browsers](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/13/webassembly-in-browsers/)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) dominates, and then [competitors](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel) show up.
* [React 16 aka fiber is released](https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/09/26/react-v16.0.html).
* React begins to rival jQuery in popularity in certain contexts.
* React [clearly](https://twitter.com/npmjs/status/949017852702543876) is the [most used](https://www.npmjs.com/npm/state-of-javascript-frameworks-2017-part-1) tool [for building UI's](https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/01/11/brutal-lifecycle-javascript-frameworks/) with state.
* Facebook [sheds its React BSD license](https://code.facebook.com/posts/300798627056246/relicensing-react-jest-flow-and-immutable-js/) for the MIT license (same for Jest, Flow, Immutable.js, and GraphQL)
* [GraphQL](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/2017-the-year-in-graphql-124a050d04c6) got [hot](https://graphcms.com/) in [2017](https://www.graphql.com/case-studies/).
* Facebook continues to [take charge in the development space](https://code.facebook.com/projects/) with forthcoming tools like [prepack.io](https://prepack.io/).
* As expected [ECMA-262 edition 8 is released](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm).
* [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) finally stabilizes.
* All modern browsers pretty much now [support ECMAScript 2015](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/) (aka ES6).
* [Async JavaScript functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) start getting some serious attention and usage. Mostly because all modern browsers [now support Async functions](https://caniuse.com/#search=async%20fun).
* Mobile development, [still](https://flutter.io/) [too](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) [hard](https://www.nativescript.org/). A strong rebellion advocating the [web platform](https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/progressive-web-apps-whats-big-deal/) as a solution to the pain [gained momentum](https://joreteg.com/blog/betting-on-the-web) this year.

# Recap of Front-end Development in 2017

* [React 16 aka fiber is released](https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/09/26/react-v16.0.html).
* React begins to rival JQuery in popularity in certain contexts.
* React [clearly](https://twitter.com/npmjs/status/949017852702543876) is the [most used](https://www.npmjs.com/npm/state-of-javascript-frameworks-2017-part-1) tool [for building UI's](https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/01/11/brutal-lifecycle-javascript-frameworks/) with state.
* Facebook sheds its React BSD license for the MIT license (same for Jest, Flow, Immutable.js, and GraphQL)
* [GraphQL](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/2017-the-year-in-graphql-124a050d04c6) got [hot](https://graphcms.com/) in [2017](https://www.graphql.com/case-studies/).
* Facebook continues to [take charge in the development space](https://code.facebook.com/projects/) with forthcoming tools like [prepack.io](https://prepack.io/).
* As expected [ECMA-262 edition 8 is released](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm).
* [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) finally stabilizes.
* HTML 5.2 is [done](https://www.w3.org/blog/2017/12/html-5-2-is-done-html-5-3-is-coming/).
* It was a banner year for [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) in terms of adoption and popularity.
* The [great](https://medium.com/@jerrylowm/the-death-of-front-end-developers-803a95e0f411) divide between a front-end HTML & CSS developer v.s. [front-end application developer is realized/verbalized](https://medium.com/@mandy.michael/is-there-any-value-in-people-who-cannot-write-javascript-d0a66b16de06). 
* This year seemed fuller than most of solutions trying to contend with the mainstream javascript app tools (i.e. [React, Angular, and Vue etc...](https://stateofjs.com/2017/front-end/results)) Let me list them for you. [Moon](http://moonjs.ga/docs/overview.html), [Marko](https://markojs.com/), [Hyperapp](https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp), [Quasar Framework](http://quasar-framework.org/), [POI](https://poi.js.org), [frint](https://frint.js.org/), [BunnyJS](https://bunnyjs.com/), [jsblocks](http://jsblocks.com/), [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.technology/), [Stimulus](https://github.com/stimulusjs/stimulus), [Choo](https://github.com/choojs/choo), 
* This was the year that jsbin and jsfiddle evolved to things like [StackBliz](https://stackblitz.com/) and [codeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/). Making it dead simple to share a working React app.
* React continues to be flattered by things like [preact](https://preactjs.com/), [inferno](https://infernojs.org/), [nerv](https://github.com/NervJS/nerv), [dva](https://github.com/dvajs/dva), and [rax](https://github.com/alibaba/rax).
* Cheatsheets got organized with [devhints.io](https://devhints.io/).
* We figured out that the correct pattern for an app boilerplate/cli tool is something very opinionated like [React Create App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) with the ability to [escape](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#npm-run-eject) from it when needed.
* Most developers have found that the combination of a really good code editor and eslint and [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) plugins make writing code faster and easier.
* CSS flexbox and grid get supported and lots more developers start paying attention to both.
* We [get](https://blog.chromium.org/2017/05/chrome-59-beta-headless-chromium-native.html), a [headless chrome](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/lkgr/headless/README.md).
* You no longer need Less or Sass [to do](https://shoelace.style) amazing [things with CSS](http://cssnext.io/features/).
* CSS [revolutions/revolts](http://ryanogles.by/css/javascript/2017/05/25/the-state-of-css.html) are under way.
* JavaScript explorer tools have arrived, [JavaScript Array Explorer](https://sdras.github.io/array-explorer/)
and [JavaScript Object Explorer](https://sdras.github.io/object-explorer/). This is a handy interface pattern for learning about JavaScript data types (e.g. Objects and Arrays) and their methods. 
* The [Chrome web browser dominates the market](http://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share) and people begin to fear the past might be [repeating itself](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16805216/google-chrome-only-sites-internet-explorer-6-web-standards).
* [Brave](https://brave.com/) becomes the most pleasant and safest way to browser the internet.
* [PhantomJS is no longer maintained](https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/04/Phantomjs-future-uncertain), [Headless Chrome](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/lkgr/headless/README.md) and [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) step in.
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) comes from left field and becomes a stable for development.
* A whole lot of developers adopt static type checking for good reasons, and also for no good reason at all.
* [Static site generators](https://www.staticgen.com/) & [API CMS tools aka Headless CMS's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_CMS) are now on most developers radar.
* Web components still lurking and wait for significant traction by developers that might never come to be.
* JavaScript settled and CSS erupt and everyone will cry fatigue by this time next year.
* YARN seems to have filled a need, because a lot of people jump the npm ship.
* A new video format for Interactive coding screencasts (recording of working in a live editor that you can edit too) becomes a real thing with [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/about).
* Most people begin to see the correlation between component architectures and [atomic design](http://patternlab.io/).
* And so it begins that ES modules [will be part of the browser](https://caniuse.com/#feat=es6-module) and if used a [backup plan](https://github.com/WebReflection/ecma) will be required (i.e. a bundle from something like webpack).
* We have only begun to [explore](https://css-in-js-playground.com/?theme=light) the ideal CSS solution for a tree of UI components.
* [MVC frameworks are on the outs](https://codeburst.io/javascript-trends-in-2018-3fb0077259).
* Older server centric [application patterns](https://unpoly.com) show [up again](https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks) but [with](https://goiabada.blog/can-you-build-a-single-page-application-without-a-front-end-framework-6799cee03750) a [new](http://triskweline.de/unpoly-rugb/#/41) [spin](https://github.com/stimulusjs/stimulus). The pendal might be swinging away fromSPA applications.
* Constructing and displaying React components outside of your applications is made popular by tools like [Bluekit](http://bluekit.blueberry.io/), [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), and [bit](https://bitsrc.io/).

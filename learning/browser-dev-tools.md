# Learn Web Developer Tools

> Web development tools allow web developers to test and debug their code. They are different from website builders and IDEs in that they do not assist in the direct creation of a webpage, rather they are tools used for testing the user facing interface of a website or web application.
>
> Web development tools come as browser add-ons or built in features in web browsers. The most popular web browsers today like, Google Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Internet Explorer, and Safari have built in tools to help web developers, and many additional add-ons can be found in their respective plugin download centers.
>
> Web development tools allow developers to work with a variety of web technologies, including HTML, CSS, the DOM, JavaScript, and other components that are handled by the web browser. Due to the increasing demand from web browsers to do more popular web browsers have included more features geared for developers.

While most browsers come equipped with web developer tools, the [Chrome developer tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) are currently the most talked about and widely used tools available.

I'd suggest learning and using the [Chrome web developer tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/), simply because the best resources for learning web developer tools revolves around Chrome DevTools.

A website or web application can run on a wide range of computers, laptops, tablets and phones, as well as a handful of new devices (watches, thermostats, fridges, etc.). How you determine what devices you'll support and how you will develop to support those devices is called, "multi-device development strategy". Below, I list the most common multi-device development strategies.

* Build a [responsive (RWD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design) web site/app for all devices.
* Build an [adaptive/progressively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_web_design) enhanced web site/app for all devices.
* Build a website, web app, native app, or hybrid-native app for each individual device or a grouping of devices.
* Attempt to retrofit something you have already built using bits and parts from strategies 1, 2 or 3.
